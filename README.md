# color_flipper
This is a javascript project for beginners. In this color_flipper, we follow the given procedure:
1. We set up the environment
2. We create a blueprint of the webpage using html
3. We design the bosy of the html document with buttons
4. We style these html elements based on our requirements
5. We then reference the javascript file using the script tag
6. Moving to the javascript file, we start by referencing the elements of the html document that we would like to access
7. we create a function called setColor(name). This function takes the parameter name as a variable which is the name of the color that the background should be set to
8. the background is then set to the name specified in the body of the function
9. We go back to main.html and add the onclick event and call the function setColor on the specific buttons color.
10. for random color we create a new function called randomColor which generates a random color when the button is clicked.
